    "As you write larger functions, you might find yourself spending more time debugging.  \n",
    "To deal with increasingly complex programs, you might want to try a process called incremental development. The goal of incremental development is to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.  \n",
    "As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two points, given by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:\n",
    "\n",
    "distance = \t√((x2 − x1)^2 + (y2 − y1)^2)\n",
    "The first step is to consider what a distance function should look like in Python. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)?\n",
    "In this case, the inputs are two points, which you can represent using four numbers. The return value is the distance represented by a floating-point value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately you can write an outline of the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):  \n",
    "    return 0.0  \n",
    "    \n",
    "Obviously, this version doesn’t compute distances; it always returns zero. But it is syntactically correct, and it runs, which means that you can test it before you make it more complicated.\n",
    "To test the new function, call it with sample arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "-distance(1, 2, 4, 6)  \n",
    "-0.0  \n",
    "I chose these values so that the horizontal distance is 3 and the vertical distance is 4; that way, the result is 5, the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle. When testing a function, it is useful to know the right answer.\n",
    "At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically correct, and we can start adding code to the body. A reasonable next step is to find the differences x2 − x1 and y2 − y1. The next version stores those values in temporary variables and prints them.\n"
